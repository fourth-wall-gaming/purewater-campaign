Purewater declares that dependency, so it should have arrived automatically --
if it did not, install it by hand, or set MYTHRAS_GM_ROOT to a checkout. Until
then: do not GM this campaign off the files in this package. They are a source
export, not a save file, and nothing you change in them reaches the game.
